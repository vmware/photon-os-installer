Ways to provide Kickstart path:

1. Remote kickstart:-

        ks=http://<kickstart-link>

2. Kickstart from cdrom attched with iso:

	ks=cdrom:/isolinux/sample_ks.cfg

3. Secondary Device Kickstart

	ks=<device-path>:<path-referential-to-device>
	Ex- ks=/dev/sr1:/isolinux/sample_ks.cfg

Kickstart config file is a json format with following possible parameters:

"additional_files": (optional)
	Contains list of pairs { source file (or directory), destination file
	(or directory) } to copy to the target system. Source file
	(directory) will be looked up in "search_path" list.
